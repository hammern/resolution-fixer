# Resolution Fixer

A friend uses an app at work that only works at a specific resolution.
This is a simple windows system tray widget that changes the display resolution when selecting the app using Tauri and the Windows API.

## Development

First install the Tauri [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) and [cli](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/).

For development run:

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

For building run:

```bash
cargo tauri build
```
